# PDF_Summarization_QA
Langchain and open ai summarization tools built to help my brother study for his medical school finals 

This is a Streamlit UI that uses langchain and open ai to sumarize and then allow the user to choose a PDF from their desk top, ask for a summarization and also allow for the user to ask questions and have the LLM give responses based on the uploaded PDF. 

Happy studying
